## Introduction

After a year's relentless efforts, today we are thrilled to release **Qwen2-VL**! Qwen2-VL is the latest version of the vision language models in the Qwen model families. 

#### Key Enhancements:

* **SoTA understanding of images of various resolution & ratio**: Qwen2-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance on visual understanding benchmarks, including MathVista, DocVQA, RealWorldQA, MTVQA, etc.

* **Understanding videos of 20min+**: with the online streaming capabilities, Qwen2-VL can understand videos over 20 minutes by high-quality video-based question answering, dialog, content creation, etc.

* **Agent that can operate your mobiles, robots, etc.**: with the abilities of complex reasoning and decision making, Qwen2-VL can be integrated with devices like mobile phones, robots, etc., for automatic operation based on visual environment and text instructions.

* **Multilingual Support**: to serve global users, besides English and Chinese, Qwen2-VL now supports the understanding of texts in different languages inside images, including most European languages, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Vietnamese, etc.

#### Model Architecture Updates:

* **Naive Dynamic Resolution**: Unlike before, Qwen2-VL can handle arbitrary image resolutions, mapping them into a dynamic number of visual tokens, offering a more human-like visual processing experience.

These results are evaluated on the benchmark of [MTVQA](https://github.com/bytedance/MTVQA/tree/main).

## Quickstart

Below, we provide simple examples to show how to use Qwen2-VL with ü§ñ ModelScope and ü§ó Transformers.

The code of Qwen2-VL has been in the latest Hugging face transformers and we advise you to build from source with command:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers accelerate
```
or you might encounter the following error:
```
KeyError: 'qwen2_vl'
```


We offer a toolkit to help you handle various types of visual input more conveniently, as if you were using an API. This includes base64, URLs, and interleaved images and videos. You can install it using the following command:

```bash
pip install qwen-vl-utils
```

### Using ü§ó  Transformers to Chat

Here we show a code snippet to show you how to use the chat model with `transformers` and `qwen_vl_utils`:

```python
from transformers import Qwen2VLForConditionalGeneration, AutoTokenizer, AutoProcessor
from qwen_vl_utils import process_vision_info

# default: Load the model on the available device(s)
model = Qwen2VLForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(
    "Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct", torch_dtype="auto", device_map="auto"
)

# We recommend enabling flash_attention_2 for better acceleration and memory saving, especially in multi-image and video scenarios.
# model = Qwen2VLForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(
#     "Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct",
#     torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
#     attn_implementation="flash_attention_2",
#     device_map="auto",
# )

# default processer
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct")

# The default range for the number of visual tokens per image in the model is 4-16384.
# You can set min_pixels and max_pixels according to your needs, such as a token range of 256-1280, to balance performance and cost.
# min_pixels = 256*28*28
# max_pixels = 1280*28*28
# processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct", min_pixels=min_pixels, max_pixels=max_pixels)

### ü§ñ ModelScope
We strongly advise users especially those in mainland China to use ModelScope. `snapshot_download` can help you solve issues concerning downloading checkpoints.

### More Usage Tips

For input images, we support local files, base64, and URLs. For videos, we currently only support local files.

```python
# You can directly insert a local file path, a URL, or a base64-encoded image into the position where you want in the text.
## Local file path
messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "image", "image": "file:///path/to/your/image.jpg"},
            {"type": "text", "text": "Describe this image."},
        ],
    }
]
## Image URL
messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "image", "image": "http://path/to/your/image.jpg"},
            {"type": "text", "text": "Describe this image."},
        ],
    }
]
## Base64 encoded image
messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "image", "image": "data:image;base64,/9j/..."},
            {"type": "text", "text": "Describe this image."},
        ],
    }
]
```
#### Image Resolution for performance boost

The model supports a wide range of resolution inputs. By default, it uses the native resolution for input, but higher resolutions can enhance performance at the cost of more computation. Users can set the minimum and maximum number of pixels to achieve an optimal configuration for their needs, such as a token count range of 256-1280, to balance speed and memory usage.

```python
min_pixels = 256 * 28 * 28
max_pixels = 1280 * 28 * 28
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(
    "Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct", min_pixels=min_pixels, max_pixels=max_pixels
)
```

Besides, We provide two methods for fine-grained control over the image size input to the model:

1. Specify exact dimensions: Directly set `resized_height` and `resized_width`. These values will be rounded to the nearest multiple of 28.

2. Define min_pixels and max_pixels: Images will be resized to maintain their aspect ratio within the range of min_pixels and max_pixels.

```python
# min_pixels and max_pixels

#### Add ids for Multiple Image Inputs
By default, images and video content are directly included in the conversation. When handling multiple images, it's helpful to add labels to the images and videos for better reference. Users can control this behavior with the following settings:
<details>
<summary>Add vision ids</summary>

```python
conversation = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [{"type": "image"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Hello, how are you?"}],
    },
    {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking. How can I assist you today?",
    },
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "text", "text": "Can you describe these images and video?"},
            {"type": "image"},
            {"type": "image"},
            {"type": "video"},
            {"type": "text", "text": "These are from my vacation."},
        ],
    },
    {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "I'd be happy to describe the images and video for you. Could you please provide more context about your vacation?",
    },
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "It was a trip to the mountains. Can you see the details in the images and video?",
    },
]

# default:
prompt_without_id = processor.apply_chat_template(
    conversation, add_generation_prompt=True
)
# Excepted output: '<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful assistant.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\n<|vision_start|><|image_pad|><|vision_end|>Hello, how are you?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nI'm doing well, thank you for asking.

#### Flash-Attention 2 to speed up generation

First, make sure to install the latest version of Flash Attention 2:

```bash
pip install -U flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

Also, you should have a hardware that is compatible with Flash-Attention 2. Read more about it in the official documentation of the [flash attention repository](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention). FlashAttention-2 can only be used when a model is loaded in `torch.float16` or `torch.bfloat16`.

To load and run a model using Flash Attention-2, simply add `attn_implementation="flash_attention_2"` when loading the model as follows:

```python
from transformers import Qwen2VLForConditionalGeneration

model = Qwen2VLForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(
    "Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct", 
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, 
    attn_implementation="flash_attention_2",
)
```

## Quantization

For quantized models, we offer two types of quantization: AWQ and GPQ([ü§ó](https://huggingface.co/collections/Qwen/qwen2-vl-66cee7455501d7126940800d)[ü§ñ](https://modelscope.cn/organization/qwen)).

### AWQ
One of our recommendations is the usage of [AWQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00978) with [AutoAWQ](https://github.com/casper-hansen/AutoAWQ). AWQ refers to Activation-aware Weight Quantization, a hardware-friendly approach for LLM low-bit weight-only quantization. AutoAWQ is an easy-to-use package for 4-bit quantized models.
#### Usage of AWQ Quantized Models with Transformers
Now, Transformers has officially supported AutoAWQ, which means that you can directly use the quantized model with Transformers. The following is a very simple code snippet showing how to run `Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct-AWQ` with the quantized model:
```python
from transformers import Qwen2VLForConditionalGeneration, AutoTokenizer, AutoProcessor
from qwen_vl_utils import process_vision_info

# We recommend enabling flash_attention_2 for better acceleration and memory saving, especially in multi-image and video scenarios.
# model = Qwen2VLForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(
#     "Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct-AWQ",
#     torch_dtype="auto",
#     attn_implementation="flash_attention_2",
#     device_map="auto",
# )

# default: Load the model on the available device(s)
model = Qwen2VLForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(
    "Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct-AWQ", torch_dtype="auto", device_map="auto"
)

# The default range for the number of visual tokens per image in the model is 4-16384. You can set min_pixels and max_pixels according to your needs, such as a token count range of 256-1280, to balance speed and memory usage.
min_pixels = 256 * 28 * 28
max_pixels = 1280 * 28 * 28
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(
    "Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct-AWQ", min_pixels=min_pixels, max_pixels=max_pixels
)

messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "image",
                "image": "https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-VL/assets/demo.jpeg",
            },
            {"type": "text", "text": "Describe this image."},
        ],
    }
]

# Preparation for inference
text = processor.apply_chat_template(
    messages, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True
)
image_inputs, video_inputs = process_vision_info(messages)
inputs = processor(
    text=[text],
    images=image_inputs,
    videos=video_inputs,
    padding=True,
    return_tensors="pt",
)

# Inference: Generation of the output
generated_ids = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=128)
generated_ids_trimmed = [
    out_ids[len(in_ids) :] for in_ids, out_ids in zip(inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)
]
output_text = processor.batch_decode(
    generated_ids_trimmed, skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False
)
print(output_text)
```
#### Quantize Your Own Model with AutoAWQ
If you want to quantize your own model to AWQ quantized models, we advise you to use AutoAWQ. It is suggested installing the forked version of the package by installing from source code:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/kq-chen/AutoAWQ.git
cd AutoAWQ
pip install numpy gekko pandas
pip install -e .
```

Suppose you have finetuned a model based on `Qwen2-VL-7B`. To build your own AWQ quantized model, you need to use the training data for calibration. Below, we provide a simple demonstration for you to run:

```python
from transformers import Qwen2VLProcessor
from awq.models.qwen2vl import Qwen2VLAWQForConditionalGeneration

# Specify paths and hyperparameters for quantization
model_path = "your_model_path"
quant_path = "your_quantized_model_path"
quant_config = {"zero_point": True, "q_group_size": 128, "w_bit": 4, "version": "GEMM"}

# Load your processor and model with AutoAWQ
processor = Qwen2VLProcessor.from_pretrained(model_path)
# We recommend enabling flash_attention_2 for better acceleration and memory saving
# model = Qwen2VLAWQForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(
#     model_path, model_type="qwen2_vl", use_cache=False, attn_implementation="flash_attention_2"
# )
model = Qwen2VLAWQForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(
    model_path, model_type="qwen2_vl", use_cache=False
)
```
Then you need to prepare your data for calibration. What you need to do is just put samples into a list, each of which is a typical chat message as shown below. you can specify `text` and `image` in `content` field, For example:
```python
dataset = [
    # message 0
    [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me who you are."},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "I am a large language model named Qwen..."},
    ],
    # message 1
    [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {"type": "image", "image": "file:///path/to/your/image.jpg"},
                {"type": "text", "text": "Output all text in the image"},
            ],
        },
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "The text in the image is balabala..."},
    ],
    # other messages...
    ...,
]
```
here, we use a caption dataset **only for demonstration**. You should replace it with your own sft dataset.

```python
def prepare_dataset(n_sample: int = 8) -> list[list[dict]]:
    from datasets import load_dataset

    dataset = load_dataset(
        "laion/220k-GPT4Vision-captions-from-LIVIS", split=f"train[:{n_sample}]"
    )
    return [
        [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": [
                    {"type": "image", "image": sample["url"]},
                    {"type": "text", "text": "generate a caption for this image"},
                ],
            },
            {"role": "assistant", "content": sample["caption"]},
        ]
        for sample in dataset
    ]


dataset = prepare_dataset()
```

Then process the dataset into tensors:
```python
from qwen_vl_utils import process_vision_info

text = processor.apply_chat_template(
    dataset, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True
)
image_inputs, video_inputs = process_vision_info(dataset)
inputs = processor(
    text=text,
    images=image_inputs,
    videos=video_inputs,
    padding=True,
    return_tensors="pt",
)
```

Then just run the calibration process by one line of code:
```python
model.quantize(calib_data=inputs, quant_config=quant_config)
```
Finally, save the quantized model:
```python
model.model.config.use_cache = model.model.generation_config.use_cache = True
model.save_quantized(quant_path, safetensors=True, shard_size="4GB")
processor.save_pretrained(quant_path)
```
Then you can obtain your own AWQ quantized model for deployment. Enjoy!
### GPTQ
#### Usage of GPTQ Models with Transformers
Now, Transformers has officially supported AutoGPTQ, which means that you can directly use the quantized model with Transformers. The following is a very simple code snippet showing how to run `Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct-GPTQ-Int4` with the quantized model:
```python
from transformers import Qwen2VLForConditionalGeneration, AutoTokenizer, AutoProcessor
from qwen_vl_utils import process_vision_info

# We recommend enabling flash_attention_2 for better acceleration and memory saving, especially in multi-image and video scenarios.
# model = Qwen2VLForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(
#     "Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct-GPTQ-Int4",
#     torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
#     attn_implementation="flash_attention_2",
#     device_map="auto",
# )

# default: Load the model on the available device(s)
model = Qwen2VLForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(
    "Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct-GPTQ-Int4", torch_dtype="auto", device_map="auto"
)

# The default range for the number of visual tokens per image in the model is 4-16384. You can set min_pixels and max_pixels according to your needs, such as a token count range of 256-1280, to balance speed and memory usage.
min_pixels = 256 * 28 * 28
max_pixels = 1280 * 28 * 28
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(
    "Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct-GPTQ-Int4", min_pixels=min_pixels, max_pixels=max_pixels
)

messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "image",
                "image": "https://qianwen-res.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/Qwen-VL/assets/demo.jpeg",
            },
            {"type": "text", "text": "Describe this image."},
        ],
    }
]

# Preparation for inference
text = processor.apply_chat_template(
    messages, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True
)
image_inputs, video_inputs = process_vision_info(messages)
inputs = processor(
    text=[text],
    images=image_inputs,
    videos=video_inputs,
    padding=True,
    return_tensors="pt",
)

# Inference: Generation of the output
generated_ids = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=128)
generated_ids_trimmed = [
    out_ids[len(in_ids) :] for in_ids, out_ids in zip(inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)
]
output_text = processor.batch_decode(
    generated_ids_trimmed, skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False
)
print(output_text)
```
#### Quantize Your Own Model with AutoGPTQ
If you want to quantize your own model to GPTQ quantized models, we advise you to use AutoGPTQ. It is suggested installing the forked version of the package by installing from source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kq-chen/AutoGPTQ.git
cd AutoGPTQ
pip install numpy gekko pandas
pip install -vvv --no-build-isolation -e .
```
Suppose you have finetuned a model based on `Qwen2-VL-7B`. To build your own GPTQ quantized model, you need to use the training data for calibration. Below, we provide a simple demonstration for you to run:
```python
from transformers import Qwen2VLProcessor
from auto_gptq import BaseQuantizeConfig
from auto_gptq.modeling import Qwen2VLGPTQForConditionalGeneration

# Specify paths and hyperparameters for quantization
model_path = "your_model_path"
quant_path = "your_quantized_model_path"
quantize_config = BaseQuantizeConfig(
    bits=8,  # 4 or 8
    group_size=128,
    damp_percent=0.1,
    desc_act=False,  # set to False can significantly speed up inference but the perplexity may slightly bad
    static_groups=False,
    sym=True,
    true_sequential=True,
)
# Load your processor and model with AutoGPTQ
processor = Qwen2VLProcessor.from_pretrained(model_path)
# We recommend enabling flash_attention_2 for better acceleration and memory saving
# model = Qwen2VLGPTQForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_path, quantize_config, attn_implementation="flash_attention_2")
model = Qwen2VLGPTQForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_path, quantize_config)
```
Then you need to prepare your data for calibration. What you need to do is just put samples into a list, each of which is a typical chat message as shown below. you can specify `text` and `image` in `content` field, For example:
```python
dataset = [

        {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me who you are."},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "I am a large language model named Qwen..."},
    ],
    # message 1
    [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {"type": "image", "image": "file:///path/to/your/image.jpg"},
                {"type": "text", "text": "Output all text in the image"},

        {"role": "assistant", "content": "The text in the image is balabala..."},
    ],
    # other messages...
    ...,
]
```
Here, we use a caption dataset **only for demonstration**. You should replace it with your own sft dataset.
```python
def prepare_dataset(n_sample: int = 20) -> list[list[dict]]:
    from datasets import load_dataset

    dataset = load_dataset(
        "laion/220k-GPT4Vision-captions-from-LIVIS", split=f"train[:{n_sample}]"
    )
    return [
        [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": [

        ]
        for sample in dataset
    ]


dataset = prepare_dataset()
```

Then process the dataset into tensors:
```python
from qwen_vl_utils import process_vision_info


def batched(iterable, n: int):
    # batched('ABCDEFG', 3) ‚Üí ABC DEF G
    assert n >= 1, "batch size must be at least one"
    from itertools import islice

    iterator = iter(iterable)
    while batch := tuple(islice(iterator, n)):
        yield batch


batch_size = 1
calib_data = []
for batch in batched(dataset, batch_size):
    text = processor.apply_chat_template(
        batch, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True
    )
    image_inputs, video_inputs = process_vision_info(batch)
    inputs = processor(
        text=text,
        images=image_inputs,
        videos=video_inputs,
        padding=True,
        return_tensors="pt",
    )
    calib_data.append(inputs)
```
Then just run the calibration process by one line of code:
```python
model.quantize(dataset, cache_examples_on_gpu=False)
```
Finally, save the quantized model:
```python
model.save_quantized(quant_path, use_safetensors=True)
processor.save_pretrained(quant_path)
```
Then you can obtain your own GPTQ quantized model for deployment. Enjoy!

#### Speed Benchmark
This section reports the speed performance of bf16 models, quantized models (including GPTQ-Int4, GPTQ-Int8 and AWQ) of the Qwen2-VL series. Specifically, we report the inference speed (tokens/s) as well as memory footprint (GB) under the conditions of different context lengths.

The environment of the evaluation with huggingface transformers is:

- NVIDIA A100 80GB
- CUDA 11.8
- Pytorch 2.2.1+cu118
- Flash Attention 2.6.1
- Transformers 4.38.2
- AutoGPTQ 0.6.0+cu118
- AutoAWQ 0.2.5+cu118 (autoawq_kernels 0.0.6+cu118)

Note:

- We use the batch size of 1 and the least number of GPUs as possible for the evalution.
- We test the speed and memory of generating 2048 tokens with the input lengths of 1, 6144, 14336, 30720, 63488, and 129024 tokens.

## Deployment

We recommend using vLLM for fast Qwen2-VL deployment and inference. You can use [this fork](https://github.com/fyabc/vllm/tree/add_qwen2_vl_new) (we are working on merging this PR into vLLM main repository).

Run the command below to start an OpenAI-compatible API service:

```bash
python -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server --served-model-name Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct --model Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct
```

Then you can use the chat API as below (via curl or Python API):

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
    "model": "Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct",
    "messages": [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": [
        {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://modelscope.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/resource/qwen.png"}},
        {"type": "text", "text": "What is the text in the illustrate?"}
    ]}
    ]
    }'
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI

# Set OpenAI's API key and API base to use vLLM's API server.
openai_api_key = "EMPTY"
openai_api_base = "http://localhost:8000/v1"

client = OpenAI(
    api_key=openai_api_key,
    base_url=openai_api_base,
)

chat_response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="Qwen2-7B-Instruct",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "image_url",
                    "image_url": {
                        "url": "https://modelscope.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/resource/qwen.png"
                    },
                },
                {"type": "text", "text": "What is the text in the illustrate?"},
            ],
        },
    ],
)
print("Chat response:", chat_response)
```

**NOTE**: Now `vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server` does not support set `min_pixels` and `max_pixels` in messages (we are working hard on supporting this feature). If you want to limit the resolution, you can set them in model's `preprocessor_config.json`:

```json
{
  "min_pixels": 50176,
  "max_pixels": 1003520,
  ...
}
```

You can also use vLLM to inference Qwen2-VL locally:

```python
from transformers import AutoProcessor
from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams
from qwen_vl_utils import process_vision_info

MODEL_PATH = "Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct"

llm = LLM(
    model=MODEL_PATH,
    limit_mm_per_prompt={"image": 10, "video": 10},
)

sampling_params = SamplingParams(
    temperature=0.1,
    top_p=0.001,
    repetition_penalty=1.05,
    max_tokens=256,
    stop_token_ids=[],
)

messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "image",
                "image": "https://modelscope.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/resource/qwen.png",
                "min_pixels": 224 * 224,
                "max_pixels": 1280 * 28 * 28,
            },
            {"type": "text", "text": "What is the text in the illustrate?"},
        ],
    },
]

processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(MODEL_PATH)
prompt = processor.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=False,
    add_generation_prompt=True,
)
image_inputs, video_inputs = process_vision_info(messages)

mm_data = {}
if image_inputs is not None:
    mm_data["image"] = image_inputs
if video_inputs is not None:
    mm_data["video"] = video_inputs

llm_inputs = {
    "prompt": prompt,
    "multi_modal_data": mm_data,
}

outputs = llm.generate([llm_inputs], sampling_params=sampling_params)
generated_text = outputs[0].outputs[0].text

print(generated_text)
```


## Training
#### LLaMA-Factory

Here we provide a script for supervised finetuning Qwen2-VL with
`LLaMA-Factory <https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory>`. This
script for supervised finetuning (SFT) has the following features:

-  Support multi-images input;

-  Support single-GPU and multi-GPU training;

-  Support full-parameter tuning, LoRA.

In the following, we introduce more details about the usage of the
script.

#### Installation

Before you start, make sure you have installed the following packages:

1. Follow the instructions of
   `LLaMA-Factory <https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory>`, and build
   the environment.
2. Install these packages (Optional):

```
pip install deepspeed
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

3. If you want to use
   `FlashAttention-2 <https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention>`,
   make sure your CUDA is 11.6 and above.

#### Data Preparation

LLaMA-Factory provides several training datasets in ``data`` folder, you
can use it directly. If you are using a custom dataset, please prepare
your dataset as follows.

1. Organize your data in a **json** file and put your data in ``data``
   folder. LLaMA-Factory supports multimodal dataset in ``sharegpt``
   format.

-  The dataset in ``sharegpt`` format should follow the below format:

```json
[
  {
    "messages": [
      {
        "content": "<image>Who are they?",
        "role": "user"
      },
      {
        "content": "They're Kane and Gretzka from Bayern Munich.",
        "role": "assistant"
      },
      {
        "content": "What are they doing?<image>",
        "role": "user"
      },
      {
        "content": "They are celebrating on the soccer field.",
        "role": "assistant"
      }
    ],
    "images": [
      "mllm_demo_data/1.jpg",
      "mllm_demo_data/1.jpg"
    ]
  },
]
```

1. Provide your dataset definition in ``data/dataset_info.json`` in the
   following format .

-  For ``sharegpt`` format dataset, the columns in ``dataset_info.json``
   should be:

```json
   "dataset_name": {
       "file_name": "dataset_name.json",
       "formatting": "sharegpt",
       "columns": {
          "messages": "messages",
          "images": "images"
        },
      "tags": {
         "role_tag": "role",
         "content_tag": "content",
         "user_tag": "user",
         "assistant_tag": "assistant"
        }
   }
```

and enjoy the training process. To make changes to your training, you
can modify the arguments in the training command to adjust the
hyperparameters. One argument to note is ``cutoff_len``, which is the
maximum length of the training data. Control this parameter to avoid OOM
error.

**Note:** For finetuning Qwen2-VL, in case you prefer a lightweight way, e.g. you would like to write your own "train loop". Here is an alternative repo for reference: [Qwen2-VL-Finetuning](https://github.com/zhangfaen/finetune-Qwen2-VL) . There are about 200 lines of effective code for preparing dataset, dataloader, train loop, etc. It is simple and straight forward. It supports flash_attention2 and distributed training.

## Function Calling

Qwen2-VL supports Function Calling (aka. Tool Calling or Tool Use). For details on how to use this capability, please refer to the Qwen-Agent project for [the function calling example](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Agent/blob/main/examples/qwen2vl_function_calling.py) and [the agent example](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Agent/blob/main/examples/qwen2vl_assistant_tooluse.py). 
### Simple Use Case
```python
# pip install qwen_agent
from typing import List, Union
from datetime import datetime
from qwen_agent.agents import FnCallAgent
from qwen_agent.gui import WebUI
from qwen_agent.tools.base import BaseToolWithFileAccess, register_tool

@register_tool("get_date")
class GetDate(BaseToolWithFileAccess):
    description = "call this tool to get the current date"
    parameters = [
        {
            "name": "lang",
            "type": "string",
            "description": "one of ['en', 'zh'], default is en",
            "required": False
        },
    ]

    def call(self, params: Union[str, dict], files: List[str] = None, **kwargs) -> str:
        super().call(params=params, files=files)
        params = self._verify_json_format_args(params)
        lang = "zh" if "zh" in params["lang"] else "en"
        now = datetime.now()
        result = now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S") + "\n"
        weekday = now.weekday()
        if lang == "zh":
            days_chinese = ["‰∏Ä", "‰∫å", "‰∏â", "Âõõ", "‰∫î", "ÂÖ≠", "Êó•"]
            result += "‰ªäÂ§©ÊòØÊòüÊúü" + days_chinese[weekday]
        else:
            days = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"]
            result += "Today is " + days[weekday]
        return result


def init_agent_service():
    llm_cfg_vl = {
        # Using Qwen2-VL deployed at any openai-compatible service such as vLLM:

        name="Qwen2-VL",
        description="function calling",
        function_list=tools,

```


## Demo
### Web UI Example

In this section, we provide instructions for users to build a web-based user interface (UI) demo. This UI demo allows users to interact with a predefined model or application through a web browser. Follow the steps below to get started.

#### Installation

Before you begin, ensure that you have the required dependencies installed on your system. You can install them by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements_web_demo.txt
```

#### Running the Demo with FlashAttention-2

Once the required packages are installed, you can launch the web demo using the following command. This command will start a web server and provide you with a link to access the UI in your web browser.

**Recommended**: For enhanced performance and efficiency, especially in multi-image and video processing scenarios, we strongly recommend using [FlashAttention-2](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention). FlashAttention-2 provides significant improvements in memory usage and speed, making it ideal for handling large-scale models and data processing.

To enable FlashAttention-2, use the following command:

```bash
python web_demo_mm.py --flash-attn2
```

This will load the model with FlashAttention-2 enabled.

**Default Usage**: If you prefer to run the demo without FlashAttention-2 or if you do not specify the `--flash-attn2` option, the demo will load the model using the standard attention implementation:

```bash
python web_demo_mm.py
```

After running the command, you‚Äôll see a link generated in the terminal similar to this:

```
Running on local: http://127.0.0.1:7860/
```

Copy this link and paste it into your browser to access the web UI, where you can interact with the model by inputting text, uploading images, or using any other provided functionalities.

#### Selecting Different Models (Qwen2-VL Series Only)

The demo is configured by default to use the `Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct` model, which is part of the Qwen2-VL series and is well-suited for various vision-language tasks. However, if you want to use a different model within the Qwen2-VL series, you can simply update the `DEFAULT_CKPT_PATH` variable in the script:

1. **Locate the `DEFAULT_CKPT_PATH` Variable**:
   Inside `web_demo_mm.py`, find the `DEFAULT_CKPT_PATH` variable that defines the model checkpoint path. It should look like this:

   ```python
   DEFAULT_CKPT_PATH = 'Qwen/Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct'
   ```

2. **Replace with a Different Qwen2-VL Model Path**:
   Modify `DEFAULT_CKPT_PATH` to point to another checkpoint path within the Qwen2-VL series. For example:

   ```python
   DEFAULT_CKPT_PATH = 'Qwen/Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct'  # Example for a different model in the series
   ```

3. **Save and Re-run**:
   After modifying the path, save the script and then re-run the demo using the instructions provided in the `Running the Demo` section above.

**Note:** This `DEFAULT_CKPT_PATH` only supports models from the Qwen2-VL series. If you're using a model outside of the Qwen2-VL series, additional changes to the codebase may be necessary.


#### Customization

Further customization of the web demo, including UI layout, interactions, and additional functionalities like handling specialized input, can be done by modifying the `web_demo_mm.py` script. This flexibility allows you to tailor the web interface to better fit specific tasks or workflows.


## Limitations

While Qwen2-VL are applicable to a wide range of visual tasks, it is equally important to understand its limitations. Here are some known restrictions:

1. Lack of Audio Support: The current model does **not comprehend audio information** within videos.
2. Data timeliness: Our image dataset is **updated until June 2023**, and information subsequent to this date may not be covered.
3. Constraints in Individuals and Intellectual Property (IP): The model's capacity to recognize specific individuals or IPs is limited, potentially failing to comprehensively cover all well-known personalities or brands.
4. Limited Capacity for Complex Instruction: When faced with intricate multi-step instructions, the model's understanding and execution capabilities require enhancement.
5. Insufficient Counting Accuracy: Particularly in complex scenes, the accuracy of object counting is not high, necessitating further improvements.
6. Weak Spatial Reasoning Skills: Especially in 3D spaces, the model's inference of object positional relationships is inadequate, making it difficult to precisely judge the relative positions of objects.

These limitations serve as ongoing directions for model optimization and improvement, and we are committed to continually enhancing the model's performance and scope of application.


## üê≥ Docker

To simplify the deploy process, we provide docker images with pre-build environments: [qwenllm/qwenvl](https://hub.docker.com/r/qwenllm/qwenvl). You only need to install the driver and download model files to launch demos.

```bash
docker run --gpus all --ipc=host --network=host --rm --name qwen2 -it qwenllm/qwenvl:2-cu121 bash
```
